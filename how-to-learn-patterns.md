Inside your head each pattern must be stored in the following data strcture:

1. Problem:
- What problem does it try to solve ? When is the pattern applicable ?

2. Solution: 
- How does the pattern solve this problem ?

3. Solution class diagram:
- You must be able to draw the class diagram for each pattern ?

4. Pattern parts and their interactions:
- Which parts (classes, interfaces) is the pattern made of ?
- How are these parts related to each other ? How do they interact ? 

5. Alternatives(!! this is the part where most learning occurs) ?
- How can you solve the problem without using this patterns ?
- What tradeoffs do you have ? 


6. Pattern variations (think of 3-5, very important for learning)
- Think about them 

7. Pros and cons 
- What are the pros and cons of this pattern ? 


8. Simple, yet bright image and use cases 
- Necessary to memeorize the pattern

9. Use cases for this pattern (make at least 10)
- Make a list of uses cases where the pattern is applicable

9. GitHubRepo with the following ...
- At least 3 examples of pattern implementation 
- Alternatives from point 5
- Pattern variations from point 6
